	According to	a study by the China Earthquake Administration ( CEA ) , the earthquake occurred along the Longmenshan fault , a thrust structure along the border of the Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian Plate .	0
`` The energy source of the Wenchuan earthquake	and	Longmenshan 's southeast push came from the strike of the Indian Plate onto the Eurasian Plate and its northward push .	0
The earthquake occurred	as a result of	motion on a northeast striking thrust fault that runs along the margin of the basin .	1
China Unicom 's service in Wenchuan	and	four nearby counties was cut off , with more than 700 towers suspended .	0
The official tally of students killed in the earthquake was not released until May 7 , 2009 , almost a year	after	the earthquake .	0
Even with the five largest cities in Sichuan suffering only minor damage from the quake , some estimates of the economic loss run higher than US$ 75 billion ,	making	the earthquake one of the costliest natural disasters in Chinese history .	2
As late	as	August 5 , yet another aftershock of 6.1 Ms ( 6.2 Mw according to USGS ) hit Qingchuan , Sichuan , causing 1 death , 32 injuries , telecommunication interruptions , and widespread hill slides blocking roads in the area including a national highway .	0
However ,	due to	the rough terrain and close proximity of the quake 's epicenter , the soldiers found it very difficult to get help to the rural regions of the province .	1
At the start of rescue operations on May 12 , 20 helicopters were deployed for the delivery of food , water ,	and	emergency aid , and also the evacuation of the injured and reconnaissance of quake-stricken areas .	0

Soon it started experiencing strong wind shear	and	continued weakening .	0
	As	a result , Talas accelerated towards the west maintaining strength and outflow .	2
As a	result	, Talas accelerated towards the west maintaining strength and outflow .	2
After landfall , Talas accelerated north at over and its central convection became significantly eroded and was displaced to the north-east	as	Talas was exposed to a very strong wind shear of over that made the LLCC very distorted and difficult to pin-point .	0
After increasing wind shear	caused	further weakening , the JTWC downgraded Kulap to a tropical depression late on September 8 .	2
Later that day , the JMA upgraded the	low	pressure area to a tropical depression north-northeast of the Northern Mariana Islands .	0
	As	a result , the JTWC ceased advisories on the storm , as it became fully extratropical .	2
As a	result	, the JTWC ceased advisories on the storm , as it became fully extratropical .	2
In the begging , Sonca seemed to have intensified rapidly since formation , however , soon the storm weakened back to a minimal tropical storm because of dry air entering the LLCC that	caused	it to elongate and weaken .	2
However , that was not for too long as vigorous convection persisted over the well defined LLCC with tightly curved banding wrapped in , Sonca continued to strengthen gradually	and	the JTWC reported winds of at least near the center .	0
	As	a result , the JMA upgraded Nesat to a severe tropical storm on September 25 .	2

After a few hours , the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression	and	designated as `` 26W '' .	0
The	following	weak tropical depressions were also monitored by one or more of the warning centres , however they were either short lived or did not significantly develop further .	0
PAGASA assigns names to tropical depressions that form within their area of responsibility	and	any tropical cyclone that might move into their area of responsibility .	0
During each season several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones , tropical storms ,	and	typhoons will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country .	0
Intensity On April 1 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) and Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) began monitoring an area of	low	pressure associated with intermittent convection over the South China Sea , roughly 535 km ( 335 mi ) east-southeast of Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam .	0
Early on April 6 , the JTWC issued their final advisory on the depression	as	it began to dissipate over open waters .	0
According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council , at least 35 people have been killed and two more are missing	as a result of	Aere .	1
The JMA then started to monitor the system	as	a tropical depression later that day , before the JTWC designated it as Tropical Depression 04W early on May 20 .	0
	As a result of	the storm , 23 people were killed in Xianning , and ten more were declared missing .	1
	Due to	an anticyclone , the system dissipated during the early morning of June 16 , as it made landfall in Hong Kong.As it drifted over Hong Kong , the Hong Kong observatory 's radar captured the center of the system .	1
Over the next couple of days the system gradually developed further , before late on June 16 , the JMA , JTWC	and	PAGASA , all reported that the system had developed into a tropical depression , with PAGASA naming it as Egay .	0
At least nine people were killed	and	three others were reported missing across the country .	0
	Due to	the Fujiwhara effect , Typhoon Ma-on , the powerful storm just northeast of Tokage , later weakened Tokage to a tropical depression and completely absorbed it early on July 16 .	1
Intensity It can be traced back to a Tropical Depression on July 10 , which made landfall over Fujian , China.The remnant low of the weak depression drifted back south , and entered the South China Sea on July 13 , and later started to reintensify	as	it drift back inland , the JMA reported that a low has strengthen into tropical depression as it drifted over Guangdong , China on July 16 .	0
Intensity Late on July 23 , an area of	low	pressure formed to the southeast of Chuuk .	0
	As	a result , the PAGASA issued their final warning on the system , downgrading it to a tropical low .	2
As a	result	, the PAGASA issued their final warning on the system , downgrading it to a tropical low .	2

As a	result	, the JMA upgraded Nesat to a severe tropical storm on September 25 .	2
The low slowly drifted north and strengthened slowly until on September 24 ,	when	the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression east of Vietnam .	0
	Due to	land interaction and colder sea surface temperature in the South China Sea , the JMA downgraded Nalgae to a severe tropical storm on October 2 .	1
Hitting the Philippines just days after Typhoon Nesat , Nalgae	caused	further damage across Luzon .	2
The PAGASA called it `` Sendong ''	as	it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility .	0
Should the list of names for a given year prove to be insufficient , names are	taken	from an auxiliary list , the first 10 of which are published each year before the season starts .	0
The name Sendong was also retired from the list after it	caused	over 300 deaths , when it made landfall on the Philippines during December 2011 .	2
European music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and popular musical forms by its system of staff notation , in use	since	about the 16th century .	0
	Given	the extremely broad variety of forms , styles , genres , and historical periods generally perceived as being described by the term `` classical music , '' it is difficult to list characteristics that can be attributed to all works of that type .	1
The concert band , another ensemble that plays classical music , consists of members of the woodwind , brass ,	and	percussion families .	0
	Many	of the most esteemed works of classical music make use of musical development , the process by which a musical idea or motif is repeated in different contexts or in altered form .	0
Beethoven , who is often described	as	a founder of the Romantic era , and Brahms , who is classified as Romantic , also used counterpoint and fugue , but other characteristics of their music define their era .	0
Ancient Greek instruments such as the aulos ( a reed instrument ) and the lyre ( a stringed instrument similar to a small harp ) eventually	led to	the modern-day instruments of a classical orchestra .	2
Social dancing became more widespread ,	so	musical forms appropriate to accompanying dance began to standardize .	2
Stringed instruments	such as	the viol had emerged by the 16th century , as had a wider variety of brass and reed instruments .	0
The tonalities of major and minor	as	means for managing dissonance and chromaticism in music took full shape .	1
The tonalities of major and minor as means	for	managing dissonance and chromaticism in music took full shape .	1
Instrumental ensembles began to distinguish and standardize by size ,	giving	rise to the early orchestra for larger ensembles , with chamber music being written for smaller groups of instruments where parts are played by individual ( instead of massed ) instruments .	2
The concerto	as	a vehicle for solo performance accompanied by an orchestra became widespread , although the relationship between soloist and orchestra was relatively simple .	0
Although Bach did not use equal temperament ,	as	a modern piano is generally tuned , changes in the temperaments from the meantone system , common at the time , to various temperaments that made modulation between all keys musically acceptable , made possible Bach 's `` Well-Tempered Clavier '' .	1
While double reeded instruments like the oboe and bassoon became somewhat standardized in the Baroque , the clarinet family of single reeds was not	widely	used until Mozart expanded its role in orchestral , chamber , and concerto settings .	0
There was also a rise , especially toward the end of the era , of nationalism in music ( echoing , in some cases , political sentiments of the time ) ,	as	composers such as Edvard Grieg , Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov , and Antonín Dvořák echoed traditional music of their homelands in their compositions .	0
Instead , musicians use the score to play music , yet	even	given the score , there is considerable controversy about how to perform the works .	0
Thus , classical performers often achieve high reputations	for	their musicianship , even if they do not compose themselves .	1
Examples include occasional music such as Brahms ' use of student drinking songs in his `` Academic Festival Overture '' , genres exemplified by Kurt Weill 's `` The Threepenny Opera '' ,	and	the influence of jazz on early - and mid-20th-century composers including Maurice Ravel , exemplified by the movement entitled `` Blues '' in his sonata for violin and piano .	0
One of the co-authors of the original studies of the Mozart effect commented `` I do	n't	think it can hurt .	0
Classical music differs from pop music because it is not made just	in order	to be popular for a short time or just to be a commercial success .	1
`` Classical music '' therefore tends to mean music that will	not	be forgotten soon after it is written , but is likely to be enjoyed by many future generations .	0
At some times in music history there have been different styles of composing for sacred	and	for secular music .	0
People then started talking about classical music	in order	to praise the great composers such as Bach , Mozart and Beethoven .	1
It has four families of instruments : the string instruments which include the violins , violas , cellos and piano , the woodwind instruments which include flutes , oboes , clarinets and bassoons together with related instruments of different sizes , the brass instruments : trumpet , trombone , tuba and French horn , and percussion instruments which nearly	always	includes timpani as well as many other possible instruments which are hit or shaken .	0
In general , musical instruments have become louder	as	concert halls have become bigger .	1
	When	they look at pieces of music in this way this is called `` musical analysis '' .	0
The greatest composers of this period	include	: Giovanni da Palestrina , Orlando di Lasso , Thomas Tallis and William Byrd .	0
	After	the wars that Napoleon had waged , there were not so many ruling aristocratic families .	1
What is known	as	20th century classical music ( or `` modern music '' ) is music from about 1910 onwards .	0
	Since	a sequence of operations can be readily changed , the computer can solve more than one kind of problem .	1
In World War II , mechanical analog computers were used	for	specialized military applications such as calculating torpedo aiming .	1
Personal computers in their various forms are icons of the Information Age and are what most people consider as `` computers . '' However , the embedded computers found in	many	devices from MP3 players to fighter aircraft and from electronic toys to industrial robots are the most numerous .	0
A combination of the planisphere and dioptra , the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out	several	different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy .	0
The sector , a calculating instrument	used	for solving problems in proportion , trigonometry , multiplication and division , and for various functions , such as squares and cube roots , was developed in the late 16th century and found application in gunnery , surveying and navigation .	1

In the US , John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E. Berry of Iowa State University developed	and	tested the Atanasoff -- Berry Computer ( ABC ) in 1942 , the first `` automatic electronic digital computer '' .	0
Changing its function required the re-wiring	and	re-structuring of the machine .	0
Compared to vacuum tubes , transistors have many advantages : they are smaller , and require less power than vacuum tubes ,	so	give off less heat .	2
His chip solved many practical problems that Kilby 's had	not	.	0
But to add together all of the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of button presses	and	a lot of time , with a near certainty of making a mistake .	0
	Since	the computer 's memory is able to store numbers , it can also store the instruction codes .	1
	For	instance , an ARM architecture computer ( such as may be found in a PDA or a hand-held videogame ) can not understand the machine language of an Intel Pentium or the AMD Athlon 64 computer that might be in a PC .	0
Bugs are	usually	not the fault of the computer .	0
	Since	the program counter is ( conceptually ) just another set of memory cells , it can be changed by calculations done in the ALU .	1
The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to addition and subtraction , or might include multiplication , division , trigonometry functions such as sine , cosine , etc. ,	and	square roots .	0
	Since	the CPU does not differentiate between different types of information , it is the software 's responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers .	1
Other arrangements are possible , but are usually	not	seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts .	0
There are typically between two and one hundred registers	depending on	the type of CPU .	1
Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items	to avoid	having to access main memory every time data is needed .	1
Hard disk drives , floppy disk drives	and	optical disc drives serve as both input and output devices .	0
	Since	modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception , it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant .	1
This method of multitasking is sometimes termed `` time-sharing ''	since	each program is allocated a `` slice '' of time in turn .	1
If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard ,	then	it will not take a `` time slice '' until the event it is waiting for has occurred .	2
Some computers are designed to distribute their work across several CPUs in a multiprocessing configuration , a technique once employed only in large and powerful machines such as supercomputers , mainframe computers	and	servers .	0
The ability to store	and	execute lists of instructions called programs makes computers extremely versatile , distinguishing them from calculators .	0
`` Software '' refers to parts of the computer which do	not	have a material form , such as programs , data , protocols , etc. .	0
Some examples are controlling traffic lights , vehicle computers , security systems , washing machines	and	digital televisions .	0
A program called a compiler translates the user 's instructions into binary code ( machine code ) and turns it into useful information that a user can easily understand , and	then	the computer will understand the instructions and do what is needed .	2
It solves problems according to instructions	given	to it by the computer user .	0
People made tools	to help	them remember where they were in a maths problem .	1
	So	people made machines that did those same things over and over .	2

	So	they put together computers .	2
Transistors replaced vacuum tubes in the 1960 's because they were smaller	and	cheaper .	0
There is another type of computer ,	called	an embedded computer .	0
When the computer wants to store the results of the program	for	later , it uses the hard disk because things stored on a hard disk can still be remembered after the computer is turned off .	0
If the	hard	drive is not erased before being thrown away , an identity thief can get the information off of the hard drive , even if the drive does n't work , and use it to steal money from the previous owner 's bank account .	0
The various drives ( CD drive , floppy drive , and on many newer computers , USB flash drive ) act like eyes , ears , and fingers , and	allow	the computer to read different types of storage , in the same way that a human can read different types of books .	2

The poor accuracy	and	reliability of these missiles raised serious doubts about their effectiveness .	0
	Since	Berlin was strategically more important than Cuba , the trade would be a win for Khrushchev .	1
Like Castro , Khrushchev felt that a U.S. invasion of Cuba was imminent , and that to lose Cuba would do	great	harm to the communist cause , especially in Latin America .	0
The Soviet leadership believed ,	based on	their perception of Kennedy 's lack of confidence during the Bay of Pigs Invasion , that he would avoid confrontation and accept the missiles as a `` fait accompli '' .	1
With important Congressional elections scheduled	for	November , the Crisis became emeshed in American politics .	0
The	resulting	lack of coverage over the island for the next five weeks became known to historians as the `` Photo Gap . `'	2

He concluded that the Soviets having 340 would	not	therefore substantially alter the strategic balance .	0
OPLAN 312 , primarily an Air Force and Navy carrier operation , was designed with enough flexibility to do anything from engaging individual missile sites to	providing	air support for OPLAN 316 's ground forces .	0
Additionally , legal experts at the State Department and Justice Department concluded that a declaration of war could be avoided so long as another legal justification ,	based on	the Rio Treaty for defense of the Western Hemisphere , was obtained via a resolution by a two-thirds vote from the members or the Organization of American States ( OAS ) .	1
	Since	it would take place in international waters , Kennedy obtained the approval of the OAS for military action under the hemispheric defense provisions of the Rio Treaty .	1
Ambassador in Turkey and NATO notified them that they were considering making an offer to withdraw what the U.S. knew to be nearly obsolete missiles from Italy and Turkey in exchange	for	the Soviet withdrawal from Cuba .	0
The concentration of aircraft in Florida strained command and support echelons ; which faced critical undermanning in security , armaments , and communications ; the absence of initial authorization for war-reserve stocks of conventional munitions forced TAC to scrounge ;	and	the lack of airlift assets to support a major airborne drop necessitated the call-up of 24 Reserve squadrons . `'	0
Robert F. Kennedy described the letter as `` very long	and	emotional . ''	0
McNamara noted that another tanker , the `` Grozny '' , was about out	and	should be intercepted .	0
	After	the EXCOMM meeting , a smaller meeting continued in the Oval Office .	0
The letter was also released directly to the press	to ensure	it could not be `` delayed . ''	0
There is some dispute as to whether removing the missiles from Italy was part of the secret agreement , although Khrushchev wrote in his memoirs that it was ; nevertheless , when the crisis had ended McNamara	gave	the order to dismantle the missiles in both Italy and Turkey .	0
At the time when the Kennedy administration thought that the Cuban Missile Crisis was resolved , nuclear tactical rockets stayed in Cuba	since	they were not part of the Kennedy-Khrushchev understandings .	1
The compromise embarrassed Khrushchev and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of U.S. missiles from Italy	and	Turkey was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev .	0
This Soviet -- American confrontation was synchronous with the Sino-Indian War , dating from the U.S. 's military blockade of Cuba ; historians speculate that the Chinese attack against India	for	disputed land was meant to coincide with the Cuban Missile Crisis .	0
Castro was forced to give way and -- much to the relief of Khrushchev and the whole Soviet government -- the tactical nuclear weapons were crated	and	returned by sea to the Soviet Union during December 1962 .	0
They stopped American aid going to Cuba ,	and	stopped buying Cuban sugar ( which was Cuba 's main export ) .	0
In a paper called `` Forty Years	After	13 Days , '' Robert McNamara quoted a part of the letter from Krushchev : Khrushchev was saying that he would remove the missile sites if President Kennedy promised not to invade Cuba .	0
Barenboim is also known for his work with the West -- Eastern Divan Orchestra , a Seville-based orchestra of young Arab	and	Israeli musicians , and as a resolute critic of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories .	0
	Since	`` I was not Jewish I had to temporarily be renamed Moshe Cohen , which made me a ` kosher witness ' , '' Mehta recalled .	1
Barenboim attempted	to keep	his relationship with Bashkirova hidden from du Pré , and believed he had succeeded .	0
In November 2006 , Lorin Maazel submitted Barenboim 's name	as	his nominee to succeed him as the New York Philharmonic 's music director .	0
When justifying his interpretation of Bach , Barenboim claims that he is interested in the long tradition of playing Bach that has existed for two	and	a half centuries , rather than in the exact style of performance that existed in Bach 's time : The study of old instruments and historic performance practice has taught us a great deal , but the main point , the impact of harmony , has been ignored .	0
This was always	the result of	`` progressive '' efforts to bring Bach closer to the particular period .	2
Noted performances	include	: the complete Mozart violin sonatas ( with Perlman ) , Brahms 's violin sonatas ( live concert with Perlman , previously in the studio with Zukerman ) , Beethoven 's and Brahms 's cello sonatas ( with du Pré ) , Beethoven 's and Tchaikovsky 's piano trios ( with du Pré and Zukerman ) , and Schubert 's `` Trout Quintet '' ( with du Pré , Perlman , Zukerman , and Zubin Mehta ) .	0
This informal ban continued	when	Israel was founded in 1948 , but from time to time unsuccessful efforts were made to end it .	0
Barenboim regarded the performance of Wagner at the 7 July concert	as	a political statement , and said he had decided to defy the ban on Wagner when a news conference he held the previous week was interrupted by the ringing of a mobile phone to the tune of Wagner 's `` Ride of the Valkyries '' .	0
In 2010 , before conducting Wagner 's `` Die Walküre '' for the gala premiere of La Scala 's season in Milan , he said that the perception of Wagner was unjustly influenced by the fact that he was Hitler 's favorite composer : `` I think a bit of the problem with Wagner is	n't	what we all know in Israel , anti-Semitism , etc. . .	0
In 1999 , Barenboim	and	Palestinian-American intellectual Edward Said jointly founded the West -- Eastern Divan Orchestra .	0

The Anglo-Saxons warred with British successor states in Wales , Cornwall , and the `` Hen Ogledd '' ( Old North ; the Brythonic-speaking parts of northern England and southern Scotland ) ,	as	well as with each other .	0
During this period several rulers attempted to unite the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms , an effort that	led to	the emergence of the Kingdom of England by the 10th century .	2
Low sea-levels meant that Britain was still attached to the continent for much of this earliest period of history ,	and	varying temperatures over tens of thousands of years meant that it was not always inhabited at all .	0
The Bronze Age sees a shift of emphasis from the communal to the individual , and the rise to prominence of increasingly powerful elites , whose power was enshrined in the control of the flow of precious resources , to manipulate tin and copper into high-status bronze objects	such as	swords and axes , and their prowess as hunters and warriors .	0
Both of these texts are	now	lost ; although quoted by later writers , not enough survives to inform the archaeological interpretation to any significant degree .	0
Some archaeologists and geneticists have challenged the long-held assumption that the invading Anglo-Saxons wiped out the native Britons in England	when	they invaded , pointing instead to the possibility of a more limited folk movement bringing a new language and culture which the natives gradually assimilated .	0
Camulodunum was burned to the ground , as well	as	Londinium and Verulamium , there is some archaeological evidence that the same happened at Winchester as well , and the Second Legion Augusta , stationed at Exeter , refused to move for fear of revolt among the locals there as well .	0

William and his nobles spoke	and	conducted court in Norman French , in England as well as in Normandy .	0
Upon Henry 's death , the Norman and English barons ignored Matilda 's claim to the throne , and thus through a series of decisions , Stephen , Henry 's favourite nephew , was welcomed by	many	in England and Normandy as their new ruler .	0
Henry destroyed the remaining adulterine castles	and	expanded his power through various means and to different levels into Ireland , Scotland , Wales , Flanders , Nantes , Brittany , Quercy , Toulouse , Bourges and Auvergne .	0
The king 's enemies , including his cousin Thomas of Lancaster , captured	and	murdered Gaveston in 1312 .	0
The autocratic	and	arrogant methods of Richard II only served to alienate the nobility more , and his forceful dispossession in 1399 by Henry IV increased the turmoil .	0
The king 's success in putting down these rebellions was	due	partly to the military ability of his eldest son , Henry of Monmouth , who later became king ( though the son managed to seize much effective power from his father in 1410 ) .	1
Six months later , Edward defeated and killed Warwick in battle	and	reclaimed the throne .	0
His eldest son and heir Edward V , aged 13 , would have succeeded him , but the king 's brother Richard , Duke of Gloucester declared his marriage to be bigamous and invalid ,	making	all his children illegitimate .	2
Nonetheless , he married Edward IV 's eldest daughter Elizabeth in January 1486 ,	thereby	uniting the houses of York and Lancaster .	2
Using a peasant boy named Lambert Simnel , who posed	as	Edward , Earl of Warwick ( the real Warwick was locked up in the Tower of London ) , he led an army of 2,000 German mercenaries paid for by Margaret of Burgundy into England .	0
The English army suffered badly from disease ,	and	Henry was not even present at the one notable victory , the Battle of the Spurs .	0
The Church would not simply grant this favour ,	so	Henry cited the passage in the Book of Leviticus where it said , `` If a man taketh his brother 's wife , he hath committed adultery ; they shall be childless . ''	2
	As	there was no possibility of getting a divorce in these circumstances , Henry decided to simply secede from the Church , in what became known as the English Reformation .	1

It took a number of years	for	the separation from Rome to be completed , however , and many were executed for resisting the king 's religious policies .	1
However , the queen	died of	puerperal sepsis ten days later .	0
	So	he married again , to a 19-year-old named Catherine Howard .	2
His sixth and last marriage was to Catherine Parr , more a nursemaid to him than anything else ,	as	his health was failing ( it had declined ever since the jousting accident in 1536 ) .	1
Kett 's Rebellion in Norfolk and the Prayer Book Rebellion in Devon and Cornwall simultaneously created a crisis during a time when invasion from Scotland	and	France were feared .	0

These saboteurs were known	as	`` Luddites '' .	0
Henceforth , all administrative counties and county boroughs would be divided into either rural or urban districts ,	allowing	more localised administration .	2

Another new weapon , the flamethrower , was first used by the German army and later adopted	by other	forces .	0
The deaths of British merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of U-boats	led to	the development of depth charges ( 1916 ) , hydrophones ( passive sonar , 1917 ) , blimps , hunter-killer submarines ( HMS `` R-1 '' , 1917 ) , forward-throwing anti-submarine weapons , and dipping hydrophones ( the latter two both abandoned in 1918 ) .	2

Were the generals to blame	for	the high casualty rates ?	0
{ Several historians like John Terraine , Niall Ferguson	and	Gary Sheffield have challenged these interpretations as partial and polemical views : These beliefs did not become widely shared because they offered the only accurate interpretation of wartime events .	0
The social trauma	caused by	unprecedented rates of casualties manifested itself in different ways , which have been the subject of subsequent historical debate .	1
